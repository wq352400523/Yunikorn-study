# YuniKorn - A Universal Scheduler

YuniKorn is a light-weighted, universal resource scheduler for container orchestrator systems.
It was created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant,
and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform scheduling experience for mixed workloads consists
of stateless batch workloads and stateful services. Support for but not limited to, YARN and Kubernetes.

## Architecture

Following chart illustrates the high-level architecture of YuniKorn.

![Architecture](docs/images/architecture.jpg)

YuniKorn consists of the following components spread over multiple code repositories.

- _Scheduler core_: the brain of the scheduler, which makes placement decisions (Allocate container X on node Y)
  according to pre configured policies. See more in current repo [yunikorn-core](https://github.com/cloudera/yunikorn-core).
- _Scheduler interface_: the common scheduler interface used by shims and the core scheduler.
  Contains the API layer (with GRPC/programming language bindings) which is agnostic to container orchestrator systems like YARN/K8s.
  See more in [yunikorn-scheduler-interface](https://github.com/cloudera/yunikorn-scheduler-interface).
- _Resource Manager shims_: allow container orchestrator systems talks to yunikorn-core through scheduler-interface.
   Which can be configured on existing clusters without code change.
   Currently, [yunikorn-k8shim](https://github.com/cloudera/yunikorn-k8shim) is available for Kubernetes integration. 
- _Scheduler User Interface_: the YuniKorn web interface for app/queue management.
   See more in [yunikorn-web](https://github.com/cloudera/yunikorn-web).
## Key features

Here are some key features of YuniKorn.

- Features to support both batch jobs and long-running/stateful services
- Hierarchy queues with min/max resource quotas.
- Resource fairness between queues, users and apps.
- Cross-queue preemption based on fairness.
- Customized resource types (like GPU) scheduling support.
- Rich placement constraints support.
- Automatically map incoming container requests to queues by policies. 
- Node partition: partition cluster to sub-clusters with dedicated quota/ACL management. 

You can find more information about what are already supported and future plans in the [Road Map](docs/roadmap.md).

## How to use

The simplest way to run YuniKorn is to build a docker image and then deployed to Kubernetes with a yaml file,
running as a customized scheduler. Then you can run workloads with this scheduler.
See more instructions from the [User Guide](./docs/user-guide.md).
